The color wheels allow the user to change the display colors of the different elements (i.e the bars, background, accessed values, and selected values), while the slider changes creates a new array based on the set value. The size is constrained the factors of the user's horizontal resolution, as to prevent improperly rendered bars.

Bars are colored whenever they are accessed.                                  

FURTHER NOTE THAT PYQT5 MUST BE INSTALLED.
